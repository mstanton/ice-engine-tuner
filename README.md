## Project Structure


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Poetry (for dependency management)

### Environment Management
We use `uv` for managing environment variables in a standardized way. To set up your environment, create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following structure:

# .env
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
API_KEY=your_api_key

### Installation
1. **Install Poetry** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   ```

2. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

### Prepare Your Dataset
Prepare your dataset in the `data/` directory. Ensure that your dataset is in CSV format and contains relevant features for training the model.

## Usage

### Train the Model
To train the model, run the following command:

```
poetry run python scripts/train_model.py
```

This script will load the test data and the trained model, then evaluate the model's performance, printing the loss value.

## Running the Application
If you plan to run an ASGI application, you can use Uvicorn. Make sure to replace `your_application:app` with the actual application entry point:

```
poetry run uvicorn your_application:app --reload
```
